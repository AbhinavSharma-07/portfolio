### [Edu Hub Case Study](https://github.com/AbhinavSharma-07/portfolio/blob/main/EduHub%20Business%20Case%20Study.ipynb)
EduHub has helped thousands of students like you make it to top colleges abroad. Be it GMAT, GRE or SAT, their unique problem-solving methods ensure maximum scores with minimum effort. They recently launched a feature where students/learners can come to their website and check their probability of getting into the IVY league college. This feature estimates the chances of graduate admission from an Indian perspective.

This analysis will help EduHub in understanding what factors are important in graduate admissions and how these factors are interrelated among themselves. It will also help predict one's chances of admission given the rest of the variables.

### [Quola Case Study](https://github.com/AbhinavSharma-07/portfolio/blob/main/Quola%20Business%20Case%20Study.ipynb)
Recruiting and retaining drivers is seen by industry watchers as a tough battle for Quola. Churn among drivers is high and it’s very easy for drivers to stop working for the service on the fly or jump to Uber depending on the rates.
As the companies get bigger, the high churn could become a bigger problem. To find new drivers, Quola is casting a wide net, including people who don’t have cars for jobs. But this acquisition is really costly. Losing drivers frequently impacts the morale of the organization and acquiring new drivers is more expensive than retaining existing ones.

This analsis is to predict whether a driver will be leaving the company or not based on several dataset attributes.
